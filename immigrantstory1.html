                    <p class="story-text">
                        I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                        But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
                        She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
                        I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"
                        First class, yo, this is bad
                        Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
                        Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
                        <p />
                    <p class="story-text">

                        Hmm, this might be all right
                        But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
                        Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
                        I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
                        I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air.

                        Well, uh
                        The plane landed and when I came out
                        There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out
                        I ain't tryna get arrested yet, I just got here
                        I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
                        I whistled for a cab and when it came near
                        The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
                        If anything I could say that this cab was rare
                        But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!"
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-text">

                        I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
                        And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo', Holmes, smell ya later"
                        I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
                        To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
                    </p>
